### Data set to note: [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aayushmishra1512/faang-complete-stock-data)
### This data set is from Kaggle. It shows the complete stock data of FAANG companies  (Facebook,Amazon,Apple,Netflix and Google) from when they became public. The data includes opening and closing price of stock, how much was sold and etc. This can be used to determine the inventment trend of the top companies of the world. People can see when to invent and what makes a successful public company.

### Interesting Data Science [book](https://www.aspeninstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/files/content/docs/pubs/The_Promise_and_Peril_of_Big_Data.pdf)
### The Promise and Peril of Big Data - David Bollier. The Aspen Institute.
### I chose it because it is a great overview of data science for begginers. It will be interesting to read about the downsides or dangers of working with big data and what mistakes to avoid.
